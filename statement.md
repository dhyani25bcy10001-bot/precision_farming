# PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Many small and medium-scale farmers lack tools for efficiently recording, analyzing, and updating key agricultural information, which leads to missed opportunities for optimization and growth.
- There is a need for a unified platform that allows farmers to manage their personal, crop-related, and yield data, and gain access to critical crop information, best practices, and government schemes.
- The project addresses both the data management gap and the need for easily accessible, actionable farming insights for precision agriculture.

# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
- The scope encompass various aspects related to integrating technology into agricultural practices to improve efficiency and productivity.
1)	Basic application to easy the task for farmers
2)	User oriented
3)	Simple programming(Easy to use)
4)	Many options available
5)	Guide and assistant for farmers
- Focus on leveraging advanced computing technologies to address challenges in modern agriculture. Key areas of exploration will include the implementation of internet of things devices for real time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity; employing data analytics and machine learning algorithms to optimize crop yield prediction and disease detection; developing a smart irrigation system for efficient water usage; and utilizing drone technology for crop health assessment and pesticide application.
- Additionally, the project will investigate the integration of mobile applications and cloud computing for remote farm management and decision support systems.
- The ultimate goal is to demonstrate how these technologies can revolutionize traditional farming practices, leading to sustainable agricultural development and increased profitability of farmers.

# TARGET USERS
- Primary users are farmers seeking to digitize their agricultural records, receive crop recommendations, and stay updated on government schemes.
- Secondary users include agricultural extension officers, rural development agencies, and agri-business professionals who want to assist farmers or analyze aggregated data.
- Administrators have dedicated functions for managing user records, crop databases, and updating system information, making the solution suitable for cooperative societies or farm collectives.

# HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES
- Secure user authentication, sign-up, and login for both farmers and administrators
- User profile management with the ability to update personal, location, land, and income data at any time.
- Crop information search, including data on sowing/harvest timing, water needs, suitable soil types, fertilizer recommendations, and optimal weather conditions.
- Personalized government scheme recommendations, outlining eligibility and benefits for various central agricultural schemes.
- Calculation and display of farm yield and estimated profit based on user data.
- Administrator dashboards for inserting, deleting, and viewing farmer and crop records.
- Modular system flow, allowing for future updates on new crops and agricultural advisories.
